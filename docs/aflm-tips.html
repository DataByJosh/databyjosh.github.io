<h3>FAQ</h3>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>How does it work?</strong>
</summary>
<p>There are three elements to each prediction in the table:
<strong>tip</strong>, the team the model is tipping to win;
<strong>margin</strong>, the amount of points the model is tipping that
team to win by; and <strong>chance</strong>, the percentage likelihood
of the tipped team winning by any margin. The table also includes
methods of evaluating all three elements of the tip. These are discussed
in detail in the other FAQs.</p>
<p>The model is still in development and as such I am not currently
releasing the details of how it makes predictions, but I may decide to
do so in the future. You are welcome to use the information below as you
see fit, but please note that you do so at your own risk. I do not
recommend or encourage the use of this information for betting.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>What is accuracy?</strong>
</summary>
<p><strong>Accuracy</strong>, quite simply, records whether the tip was
right or wrong. If the team being tipped to win the game does win, you
will see a green tick. For any other result you will see a red cross.
Until the result is known, you will see a black question mark.</p>
<p>Most users of a tipping model will be primarily concerned with how
often it correctly picks the winning team. Accuracy provides a direct
answer to this question.</p>
<p>However, past accuracy is not always the best predictor of future
accuracy. This is why other methods of evaluation are included.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>What is MAE?</strong>
</summary>
<p>The acronym <strong>MAE</strong> stands for <strong>Mean Absolute
Error</strong>.</p>
<p>The error of a tip is the amount by which the real-world margin
differs from the predicted margin. For example, if the model tips the
home team to win by 20 points, and they instead win by 35, the error for
that tip will be 15. If they win by 5, it will be -15.</p>
<p>The absolute error is the same number, but is always a positive
value. In the scenario above, whether the home team wins by 35 or 5, the
absolute error of the tip will be 15.</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>the mean absolute error is the average number of
points by which the margin prediction was wrong.</strong> The lower the
MAE, the better the model.</p>
<p>In comparison to accuracy, MAE is a superior predictor of future
accuracy. Why is this?</p>
<p>Imagine a match with tips provided by two models. Model A predicts
the home team will win by 2 points. Model B predicts the away team will
win by 30 points. The match is played, and the away team wins by 4
points.</p>
<p>Model A better predicted the outcome of the match - it was only 6
points off, while Model B missed by 26. But, Model B predicted the right
team, and Model A the wrong one. This would be reflected in MAE, but the
<em>accuracy</em> would incorrectly report Model B as superior.</p>
<p>This is an outcome that, understandably, can feel counter-intuitive.

you’re interested in reading more, I highly recommend Tony Corke’s
article on the topic on his website, Matter of Stats.</a></p>

<summary>
<strong>What are bits?</strong>
</summary>
<p>The <strong>bits</strong> measurement evaluates ‘chance’, the
probability of the tipped team winning the match by any margin.</p>
<p>If the tip is accurate, then the model will be awarded some value of
bits, depending on how probable the model declared the tip to be. The
more confident the model is in its tip, the more bits it will receive if
the tip is correct.</p>
<p>However, the same is true in reverse. If the tip is inaccurate, the
model loses some value of bits, and this value grows larger depending on
how confident the model was in the faulty prediction. A draw result also
sees the model lose bits, albeit not as many.</p>
<p>As such, bits provides something of a compromise between accuracy and
MAE. It’s a score that goes up or down depending on the real world
outcome of the match, but with the acknowledgement that the confidence
in a prediction is just as important as the prediction itself.</p>
<p>Bits are used to score the Monash University Probabilistic Footy
Tipping Competition. <a
href="https://probabilistic-footy.monash.edu/~footy/about.shtml#info">You
can find more information on how they are calculated on their
website.</a></p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>What are expected tips?</strong>
</summary>
<p>The model’s <strong>expected tips</strong> is the sum of the
prediction probability for each completed game so far. As the name
suggests, it is intended to provide an estimate of how many correct tips
the model would expect to have achieved, based on the probability it has
assigned to each prediction.</p>
<p>For example, if the model tips that a team has a 67% chance of
victory, this would be equivalent to 0.67 expected tips. Therefore in a
group of three tips all with a 67% chance, the model would expect to get
2 out of 3 tips correct (or 2.01, to be precise).</p>
<p>If the number of correct tips is significantly higher than the
expected tips, this suggests - assuming the model is calculating tip
probabilities well - that it is currently overperforming, and has
probably gotten a bit lucky with the results of some games. Likewise, if
corrected tips are significantly lower, it is probably a bit
unlucky.</p>
